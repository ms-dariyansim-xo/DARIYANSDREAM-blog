            <I>May 13th, 2022</I>
            <p>I had my original intentions to pursue a career in web development, hence the reason
                I took a chance at studying Computer Science. I started out with an overview, some ideas
                of which direction to take. Confident I'd figure it out some point during my learning
                journey.
                </p>
                
                <p>After second quarter, I enjoyed the complexity of coding, logical thinking and still was stuck on 
                    web developing as one of my careers.
                </p>
                <p>Being third quarter in and one of my courses is Front-End Development. The role has came up
                    a few times when I researched Web Programmer (though there were other focuses) but I haven't paid much attention. Learning HTML and CSS language took me back to the days when Xanga, a social media platform written
                    in HTML I believe, were
                extremely popular... From right-clicking to view a page's properties because we liked their cursor, or something
                like that. ;) 
                </p>
                <p>I'm having a lot of fun learning, experimenting and implementing and it's allowing me to be
                    as creative as possible.
                </p>
               
            <p>
                Xanga gave me the prepwork to be successful in this potential role. Haha.
