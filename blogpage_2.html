            <H5>Hearing aids[some] are considered AI</H5>
            <I>May 13th, 2022</I>
  <p>I understand Artificial Intelligence can be broken into many categories and into
      subcategories, and that's what makes AI exciting and intriguing. From what I know,
      AI is basically intelligence for its ability to "think/respond, behave" in ways humans do logically, but in other forms.  </p>
  <p>Coming from someone who was born deaf and have worn hearing aids from the age of 
      five, there definitely have been a great deal of ups and downs, from the usage of hearing aids
      of most styles, brands, with different capabilities and functionalities.
  </p>
  <p>Although I've been fortunate to be in the time where there were audiologists
      available, despite those daunting machines used to evaluate my hearing levels,
      at the time I was a bit surprised to find such limited information or details
      on deafness at birth. More specifically, research papers or facts about deafness
      NOT due to a natural cause or aging.
  </p>
  <p>However, I was pretty excited to come across this site on a brand I've used 
      and have favored for a while. They wrote an article on how one of their
      hearing aid styles is classified as AI.
