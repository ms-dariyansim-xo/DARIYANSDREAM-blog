    <p>Add on paragraph:</p>
    
    <p>Being born in the 90s, I have witnessed such a cool evolution of many game consoles between late 90s to early 2000s. As a kid, I had an obsession of places with arcade games, especially the one with Dance Dance Revolution machine.

        Needless to say, dance was one of my hobbies growing up. Therefore, most of my gaming experiences included anything-dance. We're talking a range of style from DDR machine to the one where you could play DDR at home with a dance mat. There was Hip-Hop options on "DANCE CENTRAL" by XBOX or Wii "JUST DANCE" which I truly enjoyed.
        
        I think that's why I'm pretty fascinated with Virtual and Augmented Reality devices in ways that they operate.</p></p>
