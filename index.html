    <h4>Sneak Peak [blog introduction]</h4>

    <p>Being born in the 90s, I have witnessed such a cool evolution of many game consoles between late 90s to early 2000s. As a kid, I had an obsession of places with arcade games, especially the one with Dance Dance Revolution machine.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, dance was one of my hobbies growing up. Therefore, most of my gaming experiences included anything-dance. We're talking a range of style from DDR machine to the one where you could play DDR at home with a dance mat. 
    There was Hip-Hop options on "DANCE CENTRAL" by XBOX or Wii "JUST DANCE" which I truly enjoyed.</p>
    <p>I think that's why I'm pretty fascinated with Virtual and Augmented Reality devices in ways that they operate.</p>

    <h4>..continued from another blog sample</h4>

    <p>I mentioned that one of my hobbies has influenced my fascination with the development in VR/AR devices.</p>
    <p>This is part of my consideration of specializing in AI or Machine Learning with ith aspirations to create and design two potential projects. (Of course with many more to come).
    <p>I was born deaf, technical speaking, I'm hard-of-hearing (with the help of hearing aids). Growing up in this unique "hybrid" lifestyle, being part of a deaf community, came with exposure to a handful of technologies designed to assist deaf and HoH individuals. 
    This prompts a new passion to create new hearing aids and re-design audiogram machines (test hearing levels).</p>
    <p>I personally have experienced the struggles in accessing services, that ironically created inconveniences than to provide the help requested. Part of my dreams is to change that.</p>
    <p>One example would be Relay services, where there would usually be a party of three involved: a deaf caller, the "middleman" or Sign Language interpreter, and the party to reach to. 
    One inconvenience could be the availability of the interpreters, lack of resources or poor connectivity. I'm thinking of developing a communicative device with a hologram-like projection, with a "robotic or computerized" Sign Language interpreter.</p>
