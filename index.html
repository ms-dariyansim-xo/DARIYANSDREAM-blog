    <h4>Why did you choose Computer Science?</h4>
    <p>Being born deaf into a world where we rely on communications to be successful in life, I have been exposed to a constant evolution in technologies with a purpose of creating conveniences and reducing barriers in ways that humans interact with others. Communications can take up in different forms, where a job interview could be done via Zoom or over the phone, as well as information being exchanged through text messages or emails with family and friends that may live across the country. A deaf individual like myself have used devices for both personal and professional needs, in which I gained more negative experiences than reaping the benefits behind my technology usage. </p>
