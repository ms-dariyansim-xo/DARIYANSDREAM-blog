        <I>04.11.22</I>
        <p>Being born in the 90s, I have witnessed such a cool evolution of many game consoles between late 90s to early 2000s. As a kid, I had an obsession of places with arcade games, especially the one with Dance Dance Revolution machine.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, dance was one of my hobbies growing up. Therefore, most of my gaming experiences included anything-dance. We're talking a range of style from DDR machine to the one where you could play DDR at home with a dance mat. 
        There was Hip-Hop options on "DANCE CENTRAL" by XBOX or Wii "JUST DANCE" which I truly enjoyed.</p>
        <p>I think that's why I'm pretty fascinated with Virtual and Augmented Reality devices in ways that they operate.</p>
