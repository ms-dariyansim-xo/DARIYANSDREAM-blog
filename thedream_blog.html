        <H5>Process of re-designing pages</H5>
        <i>06.01.22</i>
        <p>Slowly but surely, I'm in the process of
            "cleaning" and revising some of aesthetics of my blog pages.
            Definitely have learned a lot more since I've
            updated one of the articles. 
        </p>
        <p>My PORTFOLIO is still being developed as I'm sorting
            out some repos I've created in the past, but the previews
            are available now!
        </p>
        <p>So many ideas I almost can't even contain myself.</p>

        <H5>TenserFlow.JS Discovery!</H5>
        <i>05.21.22</i>
        <p>Thanks to Google and to my Google's search, I made a discovery from one thing after another.
            I couldn't be more thrilled and wrote an article in AI pt.1 (right-hand column). Google AI is 
            too amazing to provide all the information. TesnerFlow.JS will be an addition to my research on future
            developments.

        <p>While I'm still learning HTML/CSS and my creativity kicking in 
            since I've working on my blogs, I took it upon myself to make
            my own gifs. I used <a href="https://ezgif.com/">ezgif</a>!

        <p>These links will direct you to my articles that focus on
            my top career specialty choices. I will be updating
            my blogs, along with new skill and/or information gained through
            educational endeavors. My hope is to achieve that
            on a weekly basis.

        <H5>SNEAK PEAK [ BLOG INTRO ]</H5>
        <I>04.11.22</I>
        <p>Being born in the 90s, I have witnessed such a cool evolution of many game consoles between late 90s to early 2000s. As a kid, I had an obsession of places with arcade games, especially the one with Dance Dance Revolution machine.</p>
