            <H5>The time I used Relay Services and..</H5>
            <i>May 21st, 2022</i>
            <p>I'm so psyched! I wanted to do an depth research on Artificial Intelligence,
                what are being considered AI in terms of what we do in our daily lives.
                I decided to start off with Google AI, which is Google's webpage of education
                on AI. Not only I find that exciting, I came across something I was familiar
                with (even being an "amateur"), topics on Machine-Learning which will be one of my 
                focuses/specialties. 
            </p>
            <p>One of the key features about Machine-Learning that stands out to me is their interactive ability.
                When I discovered an interactive content titled <a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/">"AI Explorables"</a>, it certainly piqued my interest!

            </p>
            <p>I 'm discovering some tools that are utilized in machine-learning along with some cool INTERACTIVE 
                DEMOS built with TenserFlow.JS and getting a deeper understanding of what we can create!! And we have
                the ability to view their codes on GitHub-- even better!
            </p>
            <p>What's even better about this whole discovery, it's just might be exactly what I need to design/develop 
                platforms, that require something like face mesh or body mirror (you can find them in the site provided below). 
                It's a great exploration!
            </p>
            <p>https://www.tensorflow.org/js/models -- found another link where I believe you can test and use
                codes from GitHub for your experiments. The one I know I'll be diving into is the focus on
                hand models. That being the case for MY experiment on replicating ASL words, phrases, as a form of 
                communicative method in AI. (Designed for Deaf/HoH individuals).

            <H5>There's SIRI or Alexa, why not something like this?</H5>
            <I>May 13th, 2022</I>
            <p>I took an interest in AI as one of my top choices for Computer Science specialty.
                 While there are multiple career avenues to consider within this major-- I have a few products and plaforms 
                 that I wish to design, and the skills required to do has shifted me in this route.
                 <p>I plan on pursuing a bach/masters degree once I've earned my associates.</p>
                 <p>One of the products I hope to re-enhance or develop is a communicative device/platform for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities.</p> 
                 <p>If we think about the daily lives based on what we know--the devices used to create conveniences, like a text message
                     instead of a phone call, or using Siri to place an  order ahead of time while they're driving, becomes
                     an essential to certain individuals.
                 </p>                
                 </p>
                 <p>By certain people, I mean hearing people. And there's nothing wrong with that. </p>
                 <p>But speaking of Siri with Apple, there's also Amazon Alexa and so forth. They're
                     virtual assistants and are considered part of Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, Narrow AI based
                    their functions limitation.
                     This website gives a quick overview of using Siri/Alexa: <a href="https://www.thedevmasters.com/ai-tools/apple-siri#:~:text=Siri%20is%20the%20AI%2Dbased,more%20to%20display%20in%20it.">TheDevMasters.Com</a>
