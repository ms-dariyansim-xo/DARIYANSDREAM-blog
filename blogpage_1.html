            <H5>There's SIRI or Alexa, why not something like this?</H5>
            <I>May 13th, 2022</I>
            <p>I took an interest in AI as one of my top choices for Computer Science specialty.
                 While there are multiple career avenues to consider within this major-- I have a few products and plaforms 
                 that I wish to design, and the skills required to do has shifted me in this route.
                 <p>I plan on pursuing a bach/masters degree once I've earned my associates.</p>
                 <p>One of the products I hope to re-enhance or develop is a communicative device/platform for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities.</p> 
                 <p>If we think about the daily lives based on what we know--the devices used to create conveniences, like a text message
                     instead of a phone call, or using Siri to place an  order ahead of time while they're driving, becomes
                     an essential to certain individuals.
                 </p>                
                 </p>
                 <p>By certain people, I mean hearing people. And there's nothing wrong with that. </p>
                 <p>But speaking of Siri with Apple, there's also Amazon Alexa and so forth. They're
                     virtual assistants and are considered part of Artificial Intelligence.
