            <H5>Inspired to be a Systems Engineer</H5>
            <I>May 13th, 2022</I>
           <p>With my passion and goals to improve the communication world for the Deaf and HoH, 
               I also think it makes sense to take this role under consideration. Being an advocate for 
               accessibility/special accomodations and equal rights, in addition to designing hearing aids
           or a new Relay Service platform, there is a definite need to continue evolve 
        assistive/adaptive devices. </p>
